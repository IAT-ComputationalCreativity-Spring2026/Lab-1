# IAT 460 — Week 1 Lab: Introduction to Python, PyTorch, and Data Modalities

Welcome to the Week 1 lab for **IAT 460 - Computational Creativity**! This repository contains the lab materials for exploring basic programming, data manipulation, and creative computing using Python.

---

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you will get hands-on experience with:

- **Python basics**: loading, inspecting, and manipulating data.
- **Data modalities**:
  - **Images** with Pillow
  - **Audio** with librosa
  - **Symbolic music / MIDI** with pretty_midi
- **PyTorch basics**: tensors, modules, and operations (introduction only)
- **Visualization**: matplotlib and IPython display utilities

**Objectives**:

- Observe and experiment with different types of data.
- Learn to manipulate images, audio, and MIDI symbolically.
- Prepare for more advanced generative workflows later in the course.

> **Note**: You are not expected to understand all the code yet. Focus on exploration, experimentation, and discussion.

## Running python notebooks

### Option 1

If you are familiar with github, you can clone this repo and run the notebook in your IDE or tool of choice.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IAT-ComputationalCreativity-Spring2026/Lab-1.git
cd Lab-1
```

Create a python virtual environmment (Python 3.12 recommended).

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
# or
conda create -n iat460lab1 python=3.12
```

### Option 2

The provided notebook is accessible in Google Colab and requires no setup ([link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/IAT-ComputationalCreativity-Spring2026/Lab-1/blob/main/lab.ipynb))
